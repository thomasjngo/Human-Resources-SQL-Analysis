# Human-Resources-SQL-Analysis

The majority of this code was based off of exercises done in class along with some help from the Xpert Learning Assistant and Stackoverflow. CSVs were imported using PgAdmin 4 in this order: departments, titles, employees, dept_emp, dept_manager, salaries. I kept the order of the columns as close as possible to the order mentioned in the instructions. Since most of the columns were utilized to be cross referenced using primary and foreign keys, I've just decided to add "NOT NULL" to most of them. Value lengths have also been adjusted appropriately. Code has been commented wherever possible.
